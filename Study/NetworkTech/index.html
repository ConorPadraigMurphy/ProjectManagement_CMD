        <h1>Routing</h1>
        <p>
            For data, there are multiple paths in which data (packets) can be
            transferred. The paths consist of routers with information being
            transferred router-to-router in hops.
        </p>
        <p>
            Routing is an extremely complex process. It uses the routing table which
            can be statically and dynamically determined.
        </p>
        <h1>Terms</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Routing = process of sending a packet (datagram) from one network to
                another
            </li>
            <li>
                Routing table = a data structure that tells the router the next hop in
                order to get to the destination. The table is located (in memory) on
                each router.
                <ul>
                    <li>2 types = C - connection, S - static</li>
                    <li>
                        contains destination network/subnet mask, “next hop” address and
                        routing metrics (cost, admin distance)
                        <ul>
                            <li>Admin distance: the lower = more trustworthy</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Routing protocols = software that <strong>populates</strong> routing
                table. They will:
                <ul>
                    <li>Check for available routes</li>
                    <li>
                        Check for most efficient routes (by distance, speed, load, etc.)
                    </li>
                    <li>Advertise/share the efficient routes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Static Routing</h1>
        <p>Type S in routing table</p>
        <p>
            Static Routing have admins manually update the routing table to get to the
            remote network. It is mostly used on the peripheral networks (home/stub)
            which have a very small routing table and use a default route of 0.0.0.0
            (quad zero)
        </p>
        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Very efficient as no bandwidth is wasted with routing tables being
                exchanged between routers
            </li>
            <li>Possible to force data along particular path - load balancing</li>
            <li>
                Short routing table if there’s a default route of quad zero (0.0.0.0)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If a path goes down, no alternative path exists.</li>
            <li>
                If network topology changes, the table has to be updated manually.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Autonomous Systems</h2>
        <p>
            They are a group of networks that share the same routing policy. (HEA,
            Virgin Media, etc.) They are self-sustained and has a number: ASN
            (e.g.&nbsp;ASxxxx).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Independent sub-section of the internet</li>
            <li>Outside world -&gt; view as single entity</li>
            <li>
                One router within the AS is a border node (dual-homed) e.g.&nbsp;Level3
            </li>
            <li>First level routing is <strong>within</strong> an AS</li>
            <li>Next level routing is <strong>between</strong> AS</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Dynamic Routing</h1>
        <p>
            Example: RIP (routing information protocol), OSPD (open shortest path
            first), IGRP, EIGRP, IS-IS, BGP
        </p>
        <p>
            Dynamic routing is often used to keep the cost of maintaining the routing
            table down.
        </p>
        <p>Every router would:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>decides which networks it wants to “tell the world” about</li>
            <li>periodically forwards/receives ads of the router</li>
            <li>Assimilates in new routing information into routing table.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The main disadvantage is that a lot of bandwidth would be wasted by
            sending out periodic ads (routing data)
        </p>
        <p>
            Two classifications of routing protocols: distance vector and link state.
        </p>
        <img src="Files/Untitled.png" alt="Untitled" />
        <h2>Distance Vector</h2>
        <p>EIP, IGRP, EIGRP</p>
        <p>
            Displays local information, like a sign post. In the router, simply go to
            the RIP option and add IP gateways.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Routers would periodically advertise FULL routing table to all
                neighbours by broadcasting it. (10-90s updates, too frequent -
                congestion, too slow - slow convergence)
            </li>
            <li>
                Each router learns routes from its neighbours perspectives and then
                advertises these new routes from its own perspective.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>RIP would uses the route with the lowest hop as a preferred
                    route.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>If same hops = perform equal load balancing</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Link State</h2>
        <p>OSPF, etc.</p>
        <p>
            Looks at the state of the network (bandwidth, load, delay, reliability,
            congestion or any combination) and decide on the most efficient route.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Each router has a map of AS, and make the decision based on that.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The map is done by first flooding the router with ads and make an AS
                        map. Then calculate the shortest path using the map.
                    </li>
                    <li>Decided by the metric of the route</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Algorithms in this would have each router telling the world (AS) about
                its neighbours.
            </li>
            <li>Router multicasts updates whenever this network topology changes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Benefits</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Routing info propagates quicker and more stable than RIP</li>
            <li>
                Generates lower volume of traffic, as it would only advertise the
                sections that are changed.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Routing over UDP</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Uses multicasting: 224.0.0.5, 224.0.0.6</li>
            <li>
                Can perform load balancing - distribute network traffic across
                equivalent routes - creates greater flexibility.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Metric of the Route</h3>
        <p>Best route = lowest cost, calculated from bandwidth</p>
        <p>Formula:Cost = 10^8/bandwidth</p>
        <h1>Routing in the Real World</h1>
        <img src="Files/Untitled%201.png" alt="Untitled" />
        <p>
            From the diagram, there’s going to be at least one border gateway protocol
            (BGP) in an AS that routes all the other AS together. Everything goes up
            from lowest to the border
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>No router has knowledge of every network on the Internet</li>
            <li>
                Examples of AS: HEA (AS1213) has addresses 193.1.0.0/16 up to
                192.1.255.255/16
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>IANA</h2>
        <p>
            It is an organisation that issue large, short-prefix blocks of IP
            addresses to each of the five RIRS:
            <strong>ARIN (NA), LACNIC (South America), RIPE NIC (Europe), AFRINIC (Africa)
                and APNIC (Asia-Pacific)</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The individual RIRs would subdivide these blocks and allocate them to
            Local Internet Registries (LIRs) aka ISPs.
        </p>
        <p>
            The autonomous system allocates addresses to its networks/LANs.
            (193.1.56.0/21)
        </p>
        <h1>The GMIT IP Address</h1>
        <p>193.1.56.14</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                193 = RIPE NCC is responsible for addresses 193...* to 195.255.255
                destination in Europe
            </li>
            <li>1 = HEA assigned addresses with 193.1/ProjectManagement_CMD/16</li>
            <li>56 = GMIT responsible for 193.1.56.*/21</li>
            <li>14 = GMIT’s public IP addresses on the Internet</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>TCP & UDP</h1>
        <p>
            The transport layer: there are two protocols available - TCP (Transmission
            Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
        </p>
        <img src="Files/Untitled%202.png" alt="Untitled" />
        <ul>
            <li>Protocol Data Unit (PDU) called a <strong>segment</strong></li>
            <li><strong>End-to-end service</strong></li>
            <li>
                <strong>Layer 4 data stream = only relevant on source and destination
                    device</strong>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Port Numbers</h1>
        <p>
            They are used to identify applications running on a device on both source
            and destination. Up to 65,536 (2^16) different port numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
            It uses <strong>a socket</strong> which is an end point in communication.
            It allows multiple software apps to simultaneously use a single IP
            address. Format: IP:Port. Example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>192.168.1.70:<strong>80</strong> = HTTP</li>
            <li>192.168.1.7:<strong>443</strong> = HTTPS</li>
            <li>192.168.1.7:<strong>3306</strong> = MySQL</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="Files/Untitled%203.png" alt="Untitled" />
        <h1>UDP and TCP</h1>
        <img src="Files/Untitled%204.png" alt="Untitled" />
        <h2>UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</h2>
        <p>
            Bare bones transport protocol. Segments may be lost or delivered out of
            order. Deemed as
            <strong>connection less - fast, no handshaking.</strong> Each UDP segment
            is also handled independently of others.
        </p>
        <img src="Files/Untitled%205.png" alt="Untitled" />
        <h2>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</h2>
        <p>
            TCP Layer 4 enhances services provided by layer 3 (which packets can be
            lost) This is a <strong>reliable delivery service.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Point-to-point protocol - app-to-app</li>
            <li>Full duplex - MSS: maximum segment size</li>
            <li>Connection-oriented via handshaking</li>
            <li>Flow controlled: sender not overwhelm receiver.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Mechanism:</p>
        <img src="Files/Untitled%206.png" alt="Untitled" />
        <p>
            The yellow square = windows - how much data would send/receive (windows
            size) Segment:
        </p>
        <img src="Files/Untitled%207.png" alt="Untitled" />
        <h3>Piggy Backing</h3>
        <p>
            TCP uses Piggy Backing. As well as application data, TCP also include
            control information which “piggy backs” on actual data being sent.
        </p>
        <h3>Connection Set-Up</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Header: port numbers (source and destination), sequence number,
                acknowledgement number
            </li>
            <li>Control: Syn, Ack</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Two devices would synchronise on each other’s TCP initial sequence numbers
            (OSN):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Sequence numbers would track the order of data and ensure that no data
                is lost.
            </li>
            <li>
                ISN do not start at 0 or 1 as TCP Sequence Prediction Attacks could
                occur, if both side started with 0.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Three way handshake: -&gt; SYN -&gt; SYN-ACK -&gt; ACK</p>
        <img src="Files/Untitled%208.png" alt="Untitled" />
        <h3>Connection Termination</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Two FIN flags to terminate a session.</li>
            <li>
                Device enters a FIN-WAIT state. No additional data is accepted, but
                continue to receive segment from a server
            </li>
        </ul>
        <img src="Files/Untitled%209.png" alt="Untitled" />
        <h3>TCP SYN Flooding</h3>
        <p>
            This is when an attacker sends a SYN request with a spoofed source IP to a
            host. Everything will be the same but there would
            <strong>never be a final ACK message, which results in half-open
                connections.</strong>
            More of this = too much backlog = Denial of Service (DoS)
        </p>
        <p>
            Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is similar to this, but with multiple
            attacking devices instead.

        <ul>
            <li>
                It has a total of 100k+ databases called <strong>name servers</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each has a <strong>zone file.</strong></li>
                    <li>Each row in the database are <strong>records</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Many record types
                <ul>
                    <li>A = IPv4 address (AAAA = IPv6 address)</li>
                    <li><strong>CNAME = CANONICAL NAME aka alias</strong></li>
                    <li>MX = mail server</li>
                    <li>NS = name server</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Uses port 53 - query and response control</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To display the DNS, type in command prompt:
            <strong>ipconfig/displaydns</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>DNS would go in pairs:</strong> master/slave or primary/secondary.
            This is to balance the load of the servers. They are both in sync.
        </p>
        <h1>Classes of DNS Servers</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Root DNS</li>
            <li>TLD - Top-Level Domain e.g.&nbsp;.ie, .com</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Authoritative</strong> DNS Servers -&gt; maintained by
                <strong>organisation</strong> or ISP
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Local/Cache/Default</strong> Name Servers -&gt; Uses
                <strong>caching servers</strong> (temporary storage)
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once any name server learns mapping -&gt; caches</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Has TTL (time to live)</li>
            <li>Root name servers are not visited often in this case.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="Files/Untitled%2010.png" alt="Untitled" />
        <h2>Root DNS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Contains mappings for all TLDs</li>
            <li>The zone file indicates who to contact next</li>
            <li>Has 13 routes - A route, B route, etc. They are all cloned.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Format:</p>
        <p>TLD, TTL, IN, TYPE, LINK</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>.ie, 172800, IN, NG, d.ns.ie</p>
        <p>ns stands for name servers</p>
        <h2>Top-Level Domains</h2>
        <p>1,488 TLDs</p>
        <p>
            Internet Assigned Numbers Authority would classify the domains into three
            types:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Country code TLD (ccTLD) = .ie, .th, .tv</li>
            <li>Generic TLD (gTLD) = .com, .net</li>
            <li>Infrastructure TLD - ARPA and such</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Authoritative DNS servers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Contain zone files</li>
            <li>Owned and managed by organisation / company</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>DNS Cache/Local/Default Servers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No zone files</strong></li>
            <li>Provided Caching service for DNS data</li>
            <li>Located in end devices / ISP / etc</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Example DNS: Google DNS</h2>
        <p>Primary: 8.8.8.8, Secondary: 8.8.4.4</p>
        <p>They are considered as <strong>anycast</strong> address</p>
        <h1>DNS Queries</h1>
        <p>Seperated into two types: recursive and iterative</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A <strong>recursive</strong> request puts the responsibility on the root
                server where as the…
            </li>
            <li>
                I<strong>terative</strong> request spreads out the load between all the
                DNS servers.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In reality, <strong>recursive query</strong> is used between the machine
            and the local DNS servers that were set up.
            <strong>Iterative queries</strong> are used in between those DNS servers
            and higher-up DNS servers
        </p>
        <h1>Zone Files</h1>
        <p>in System32, if DNS is implemented</p>
        <p>Zone files contain zone information -&gt; collection of records.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Format: domain_name.zone</li>
            <li>
                Records: Resource Records (20+ types)
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Examples: SOA (Start of Authority), A/AAAA, CNAME, MX, RRSIG
                        (digital signature)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Each domain has two servers -&gt; master & slave (primary/secondary,
                DNS1/DNS2)
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It is possible to have more than two servers, usually in pairs.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Slave periodically request update from Master -&gt; zone transfer</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <img src="Files/Untitled%2011.png" alt="Untitled" />
        <h1>DNS Spoofing (DNS Cache Spoofing)</h1>
        <p>
            Traditional DNS queries and responses are sent without encryption. Corrupt
            data is introduced for those data, which would return incorrect IP
            addresses.
        </p>
        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) - supported by
                8.8.8.8
            </li>
            <li>Add <strong>authentication</strong> trust layer</li>
            <li>
                Each <strong>zone</strong> has private/public key pair
                <ul>
                    <li>Public key is published using DNS (DNSKEY)</li>
                    <li>
                        Private key is stored safe and offline, containing individualised
                        DNS data
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Prevention Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Group all the records of the same type into a RR set</li>
            <li>Generate digital structure (RRSIG) with private key</li>
            <li>Add RRSIG to zone file</li>
            <li>Add DNSKEY (public) to zone file.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Each cache receiving a response must verify the authenticity of the name
            server.
        </p>
        <h2>Alternative to DNSSEC</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>dns.google.com (DNS-over-HTTPS)</li>
            <li>OpenDNA</li>

        <h1>Transport Layer Security (TLS)</h1>
        <p>To be continued in week 6</p>
        <p>
            TLS is a follow on of SSL (Secure Socket Layer) TLS is also in the
            application layer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Two algorithms are used: <strong>encryption</strong> and
            <strong>hash</strong> (for integrity)
        </p>
        <p>Security has three main components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Authentication</strong> - verification</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Integrity</strong> - quality of data - data shouldn’t be
                changed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Confidentiality</strong> - encrypted - either symmetric or
                asymmetric
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>TLS implements all 3 of the security components</p>
        <h1>Types of Encryption</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Symmetric encryption - oldest and fastest EXCEPT on how to get a key
                from A to B
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The key is also called, session key, symmetric key or shared key
                    </li>
                    <li>Size: 128/256 bits wide.</li>
                    <li>
                        Two types of key distribution:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Out-of-band key distribution - physical usage (text, owls,
                                letter) - but slow
                            </li>
                            <li>In-band key distribution: RSA, DHE, ECDHE</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Algorithms used: AES (advanced encryption standard), DES (data
                        encryption standard), CCM, GCM
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Asymmetric encryption
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Two separate keys, public and private
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If data is <strong>encrypted</strong> by
                                <strong>public key</strong> and <strong>decrypted</strong> by
                                <strong>private key</strong> -&gt; determines
                                <strong>confidentiality</strong>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If data is <strong>encrypted</strong> by
                                <strong>private key</strong> and <strong>decrypted</strong> by
                                <strong>public key</strong> -&gt; determines
                                <strong>authentication</strong>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Size: 2k-8k bits – 4k bits require by most</li>
                    <li>Algorithms used: RSA (usage of certificates, see below), DSA</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Certificates</h1>
        <p>
            Certificates are usually 509 certificates, storing the public keys. It
            contains:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>name of subject</li>
            <li>name of issuer</li>
            <li>public key value</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Certificates can be either paid or free (if free, the integrity of the
            issuer is also considered)
        </p>
        <p>Authentication is by two types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                One-way = default
                <ul>
                    <li>You don’t know who the person connected to are.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Two-way (mutual) = optional, doesn’t have as both have to have their own
                certificates -&gt; cost money
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        OR (WITHOUT CERTIFICATE) each has to give its authenticative data
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>TLS</h1>
        <p>
            TLS is a set of protocols, 4 types of protocols: TLS Handshaking, TLS
            Change Cipher Spec, TLS Alert and TLS Record
        </p>
        <h2>Handshaking Protocol</h2>
        <p>The handshaking protocol starts with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Asymmetric encryption, by which the user encrypts the data by their
                public key with the receiving end decrypting it using their private key
            </li>
            <li>
                They then exchange keys (shared keys) with each other using RSA. With
                that, they will use symmetric encryption from then onwards.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Three types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>RSA Handshaking (described above)</li>
            <li>Diffie - Hellman Ephermeral (DHE)</li>
            <li>Elliptic Curve Diffie - Hellman Ephermeral (ECDHE)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Cipher Suite</h2>
        <p>
            Cipher suite are used to determine how the client and the server would
            exchange information to each other for authentication purposes. Format:
        </p>
        <p>
            Key Exchange Algorithm_Key Exchange_Symmetric Encryption Algorithm_Data
            Algorithms
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Key Exchange Algorithm = how symmetric key is generated and distributed
                (RSA, DHE, ECDHE)
            </li>
            <li>Key Exchange = digitial signature on d, g parameters</li>
            <li>Symmetric Encryption Algorithm = bulk algorithm (AES*, DES, etc.)</li>
            <li>Data Algorithms = SHA1, SHA256, etc. – secure hash algorithm</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Protocols</h2>

            <li><strong>Application Data Exchanges</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            RSA key encryption is not use at all in current time as if old machines
            having the private key are passed over to someone else, they can use it in
            a malicious way. PFS (perfect forward security) makes sure that everything
            can be used in the future.
